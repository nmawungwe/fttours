        Durban
        City in South Africa
        Durban, a coastal city in eastern South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province, is known for its African, Indian and colonial influences. Refurbished for soccer’s 2010 World Cup, the seafront promenade runs from uShaka Marine World, a huge theme park with an aquarium, to the futuristic Moses Mabhida Stadium. The Durban Botanical Gardens showcases African plant species
        The Golden Mile beachfront is a popular destination for water sports. Durban’s surfing spots range from beginner breaks at Addington and South beaches to the challenging Cave Rock at Brighton Beach. Inland, vendors at the Warwick Junction street markets include Zulu shopkeepers offering traditional medicines and Indian food carts selling “bunny chow,” a traditional curry dish. The Campbell Collections, a museum and library in a neo-Cape Dutch home, displays African art and artifacts that explore the city’s ethnic mix. The Port Natal Maritime Museum, based on 3 vessels in the harbor, traces the city’s seafaring tradition.

    <p class="expPar"><img class="imgExp" src="/imgs/packages/Drakensberg Mountain.jpg" style="width:40%; height:230px">
        The accommodation in the Drakensberg region is extraordinary, thanks to the dramatically beautiful setting. This region is home to the awe-inspiring mountain range of the same name and can predominantly be found in the KwaZulu Natal Province. The range is more than 200 kilometres long and combines rugged peaks with verdant valleys and spectacular backdrops. It creates a natural border between the kingdom of Lesotho and the province of KwaZulu-Natal.

        Its name, Drakensberg, roughly translate to “dragon mountains” or “the mountains of dragons”. And, it’s no wonder that it has earned this name because some of the peaks are mammoth in size and stature. The average height of the range is 2 900 metres. However, it is home to some of the country’s highest peaks, which surge up to 3 482 metres above sea level. Between and amongst these peaks are plateaus, valleys, slopes, and incredible mountain passes that make for some of the best hiking, walking and cycling adventures in South Africa.

        Cape Town is a port city on South Africa’s southwest coast, on a peninsula beneath the imposing Table Mountain. Slowly rotating cable cars climb to the mountain’s flat top, from which there are sweeping views of the city, the busy harbor and boats heading for Robben Island, the notorious prison that once held Nelson Mandela, which is now a living museum.

        Mpumalanga (Zulu name for "the place where the sun rises") is a province in eastern South Africa, bordering the nations of Swaziland and Mozambique. It embraces the southern half of Kruger National Park, a huge nature reserve with abundant wildlife including big game. The province's iconic Blyde River Canyon, among the world’s largest, is known as a green canyon because of its subtropical foliage.
